            "The input contract is missing sections related to specific details of the agreement, which are present in the reference contract's schedules and some clauses.  These include:\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Product List (Schedule 1):**  The reference contract specifies the exact products being distributed (AriaT™ Hip Stem System, etc.). The input contract mentions \"cryptocurrency mining rigs and parts,\" but lacks specific product names and model numbers.\n",
            "* **Territory Definition (Schedule 2):** While the input contract defines the territory as Taiwan, the reference contract utilizes a Schedule 2 for a potentially more complex territory definition.\n",
            "* **Trademark List (Schedule 3):** The reference contract lists specific trademarks in Schedule 3, while the input contract mentions \"JRVS Trademarks\" but doesn't list them.\n",
            "* **Pricing (Schedule 4):**  The reference contract details pricing per product in Schedule 4. The input contract describes pricing mechanisms but not specific prices.\n",
            "* **Signatures and Dates:** The reference contract has formatted signature blocks. While the input contract *does* include signatures, it's simpler and lacks the director/secretary distinctions.\n",
            "* **Some \"Standard Clauses\":** Many of the interpretation and boilerplate clauses (e.g., singular vs. plural, headings, etc.) from Section 1 of the reference contract are absent in the input.  While not strictly *missing,* their absence could create ambiguity.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "**2. Differences in Matching Sections:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Section Titles/Content:**  Although both contracts have similar section titles (e.g., \"Appointment,\" \"Term and Termination\"), the *content* within those sections differs significantly.  The reference contract reflects a medical device distributorship, whereas the input contract deals with cryptocurrency mining equipment. The specifics of obligations, warranties, liabilities, etc., are all tailored to the respective industries.\n",
            "* **Warranty:** The reference contract includes a product liability indemnity from the supplier, whereas the input contract explicitly states JRVS offers NO warranty, pushing any warranty responsibility to the component manufacturer.  This is a *major* difference.\n",
            "* **Governing Law/Jurisdiction:** The reference contract specifies Ohio law and jurisdiction, while the input contract chooses Indiana law and Hamilton County jurisdiction.\n",
            "* **Payment Terms:** While both discuss payment, the specifics differ (e.g., net 30 days in the input vs. 45 days in the reference, currency).\n",
            "* **Termination:** The termination clauses, while conceptually similar, have different notice periods and specific events triggering termination for cause.\n",
            "\n",
            "**3. Additional Sections in Input Contract (Not in Reference):**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Recitals:**  The input contract starts with \"Recitals,\" providing background context not present in the reference contract.\n",
            "* **Rolling Forecast (Section 4.1):** The input contract includes a rolling forecast requirement, not mentioned in the reference contract.\n",
            "* **Meet Comp Pricing (Section 5.3):**  The \"meet comp\" pricing concept in the input contract doesn't have a direct equivalent in the reference contract.\n",
            "* **Audits (Section 3.9):**  More detailed audit rights are granted to JRVS in the input contract.\n",
            "* **Export Control (Section 15.7):** Specific mention of export control regulations appears in the input contract, relevant to the technology sector, but is absent from the reference contract.\n",
            "\n",
            "**4. Suggestions for Input Contract:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Specificity:** Add schedules or clauses to detail the product list, trademarks, territory (if more complex than just Taiwan), and pricing.  This removes ambiguity and makes the contract more enforceable.\n",
            "* **Standard Clauses:** Consider incorporating standard boilerplate clauses regarding interpretation, notices, severability, etc., for greater clarity and completeness.  Many standard contract templates can provide these.\n",
            "* **Warranty Clarity:**  The complete lack of warranty from JRVS is unusual, especially for a distributor agreement.  Clarify this section thoroughly, ensuring the distributor understands the implications and has recourse if components are faulty.  Consider whether a limited warranty from JRVS, even if it passes through manufacturer warranties, might be appropriate.\n",
            "* **Termination Consequences:**  Be more specific about the consequences of termination regarding existing inventory. Does the distributor have a right to return unsold products? Are there restocking fees?\n",
            "* **Legal Review:** Have the contract reviewed by legal counsel specializing in distribution agreements and intellectual property. This is crucial given the no-warranty provision and the importance of intellectual property in the cryptocurrency mining sector.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "By addressing these points, the input contract will be more robust, clearer, and offer better protection for both parties.\n"
